            "While many can pursue their dreams in solitude, other dreams are
            like great storms blowing hundreds, even thousands of dreams apart
            in their wake. Dreams breathe life into men and can cage them in
            suffering. Men live and die by their dreams. But long after they
            have been abandoned they still smolder deep in menâ€™s hearts. Some
            see nothing more than life and death. They are dead, for they have
            no dreams."
